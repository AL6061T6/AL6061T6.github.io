'14.9.1 ~ '16.5.31 : Duty for Korean Army, (Sergeant, Defense Security Unit) <br>
'13.3.1 ~ '20.2.5 : Graduate from Chung-Ang University (Mechanical Engineering) <br>
'20.1.6 ~ Now : Robot Associate for LG Electronics (CAE & Robot Solution) <br><br>


I decided my major as mechanical engineering because I was interested in physics and I thought I could make anything I want if I major in engineering.<br>
But things are not that easy, I'm not that super smart to be a great engineer and mechanical engineering was not really for making something, rather it was more for dynamics. <br>
Now I'm working as Robot Associate and continue to do my sewing or making project,<br>
and dream about to get a job related with making any kawaii things, like doll.<br><br>
