I was shy boy who cares about anything too much and indulged in Japanese anime. <Br>
I expected mechanical engineering would help me to get a mediocre life which is my favorite subject, and I selected it as my major.<br>
Now I'm working as robot research associate but,<b><i> start feeling to get a job related with what I really like, something animetic, or kwaii things, more than just making ends meet.</I></b><br>
<br>
I've done lots of fanarts related with Japanese anime culture, <b><i>drawing and sewing </i></b> are the one of them. <br>
I really loved drawing, but because I was terrible at it, it was not very effective to learn or be good at it.<br>
<b><i>At least I thought I was decent at sewing, so It would be a sewing which could give profits, rather than a drawing.</i></b><br>
<br>
<i>Would sewing gives me way for new earings?</i><Br>
<br>
I've been big fan of making doll's clothing quite a long time, and made outfits for my first doll Jasmine, Blue Fairy.<br>
But I wanted to get a new one to let sewing project get traction, so I searched lots of doll I could get and, SmartDoll was the most impressive one that moves my minds. <br>
Although I don't know Danny choo at all who is maker of SmartDoll, after I read about precaution for purchasing SmartDoll, I searched about what kind of doll it is and how SmartDoll is started.<br>
<br>
The story of SmartDoll was just overwhelming to me. <br>
Could someone build his comapny and make a signature doll just with will to own company and love for charcter?<Br>
It just sounded like insane and felt so jealous. <b><i>It was really my ideal life I deadly wanted.</i></b><Br>
I convinced that only SmartDoll can give this kind of energetic story for me, and I decided to purchased one, Mirai. <br>
<br>
Still I don't know what kind of activity could gives me reasonable protifs or helps me to  for me at all.<br>
But, I cannot just do nothing,so I started to make outifts of Mirai with my all of skill I gott from previous fanart works, and do social media.<br>
I know I could not make it as much as another person had done, I hope I could also find my way to make sewing as part of my earnings.
