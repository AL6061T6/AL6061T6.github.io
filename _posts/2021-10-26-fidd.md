#### Test Positng

Before then, I did not upload my sewing projects or making process on other personal pages.
I only used social media service like "Twitter" or "Naver Blog".
One day, my coworker said to me that he is running a blog in "Tistory" for earning some pocket money by ad profit

##### Google AdSense

I didn't understand what exactly he said about, but it seems like that he earn some ad profit by "Tistory" like blog, which provide source code.
He said he post information about recent stock or some tips for graduate school.

##### If he can... why can't I...?

I've done my blog on "Naver" since I was middle school student, and I have powerful information to someone who want to make plushie or clothes for doll.... at least I think 

##### Just at this time, I ordered my Smart Doll and it's good time to start to manage new website with my new doll.

First I thought I would also start with "Tistory", but it's only used in my country.
To be honest it's not that famous for normal people.
If I get stated to manage blog, then the most frequently uploaded articles would be making process and information which does not really have national limitation.

##### The more accessibility is the better.

So I stated to find how to create universal webpage or blog, then I arrived at Github page
Thanks to prior pioneer, I can easily create my webpage although all I know about "coding" is using pandas or numpy library on python.

Still there're so many things I should learn for making details, and actually it's my first time to post articles in English xD

I don't think it would be just as easy...

but I would do my best :)
